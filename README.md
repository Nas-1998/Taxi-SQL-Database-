# Taxi-SQL-Database-
As part of my Masters Semi-structured Data and Advanced Data Modelling module I worked as part of a team to create a database for a taxi service where I used ER and Relation schema diagrams to create it in order for the business to manage their clients, drivers, vehicles, payments and revenue bookings. Additionally, PL/SQL was used to implement the database with a variety of queries and triggers to get specific data.
